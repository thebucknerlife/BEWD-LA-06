Lists and Loops
================

Lists and loops are the foundational concepts in software that allow us to
repeat commonly done tasks. An example would be an email mailing list. You
wouldn't want to write a custom script to email each user individually. It is
more efficient to write a script to send a single user an email, but repeat that
for every email in the list.

Goals
-----

* Creating a list from scratch
* Adding/removing elements to a list
* Getting elements out of a list
* Calling `#each` to repeat a block for each element in a list
* Twilio SMS texting

Agenda
------

* Arrays are lists
* IRB demo
* `.each do` Demo
* Paper demo
* Codealong: [hungry-app](hungry-app.md)
* Pushing hungry-app to Github
* Lab: [Integrating Twilio into hungry-app](hungry-app.md)
