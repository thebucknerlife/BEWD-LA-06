Hashes and APIs
================

Hashes are the final foundational structure we will learn before moving into Rails. While lists are powerful for storing lots of similar items (and performing the same action on each of them), hashes let us store lots of information inside one item. 

We will cover hash basics then move into combining hashes and array together to do some really cool stuff. Finally, we'll talk about APIs and how arrays/hashes relate.

Goals
-----

* Create a hash from scratch
* Adding/removing elements from a hash
* Putting hashes inside an array and iterating over them using `#each`
* Looking at APIs for the first time via mashable.com

Agenda
------

* Introduce hashes
* Codealong: [hungry-app](hungry-app.rb)
* Lab: [Improve hungry-app](improve-hungry-app.md)
* APIs: [The Mashable API](mashable-api.md)
