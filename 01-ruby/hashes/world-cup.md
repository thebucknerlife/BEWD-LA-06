Homework: Tell Me About Today's World Cup Games
===============================================

* Using [world-cup.rb](https://github.com/ga-students/BEWD-LA-05/blob/master/01-ruby/hashes/world-cup.rb) as an example, use the [httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) gem to talk to [World Cup JSON](http://worldcup.sfg.io/)
* Write a program that loops through each match and outputs the match data for today's matches.
* Required: Match status, location and winner (if the winner is null, respond with 'No Winner')

Bonus
-----

* Build a class to encapsulate the above world cup example
* Use the class to output the status and location of today's matches

Super Extra Bonus
------

* Build a program that asks the user which country they are rooting for
* Use the World Cup JSON [matches endpoint](http://worldcup.sfg.io/matches) to return all matches played for that country
