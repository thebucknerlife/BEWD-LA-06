Mad Libs
========

Our job is to write 2 programs performing mad libs. One of them will print a
message such as the following:

```
I had a ((an adjective)) sandwich for lunch today. It dripped all over my ((a
body part)) and ((a noun)).
```

The other will say:

```
Our favorite language is ((programming language)). We think ((programming language)) is better than ((
gemstone)).
```

BONUS 1:

Make sure everything is lower case. So if the user enters `ELBOW` make sure the madlib outputs `elbow`.

BONUS 2:

If the input entered by the user for gemstone is 'ruby', the madlib should say this instead:

```
Our favorite language is ((programming language)). We think ((gemstone)) is better than ((
programming language)).
```
