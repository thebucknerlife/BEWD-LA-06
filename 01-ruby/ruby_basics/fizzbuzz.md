Fizzbuzz
========

Based on a traditional English children's game.

Requirements
-------------

* Print the numbers 1..100 to the console.
* For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
* For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
* For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
* Write a comment explaining each line of your script.
* Email your ruby script to bita@bitadj.com.


Important Hint
--------------

You'll need to use the modulus operator ('%') here. Use Google to figure out what the modulus operator does and how you can test divisibility with it.
